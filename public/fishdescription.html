The Golden Fish is extremely elusive and will begin to flee the moment it senses a fisherman's hook, and because of this, very little is known about it. The only two things that are known is that its shimmering scales are made of pure 24 carat gold and that if a fisherman is to profit from an encounter with the Golden Fish, they need to think quick. Sadly, most encounters with this mythical creature are often brief and fleeting, making it a symbol of both hope and frustration"

They are one of the earliest groups of arthropods to appear in the fossil record and were among the most successful of all early animals, existing in the oceans for almost 270 million years. 520 million years ago, the last trilobites disappeared in the end-Permian mass extinction event about 252 million years ago. That was, of course, until 2025 when a rumour started of alive specimens just off the west coast of Ireland... "

        document.getElementById('fishdesc').innerHTML="Length: 200-250cm<br>Weight: 225-250kg<br>Lifespan: Up to 15years<br><br>Atlantic Bluefins are native to both the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. They have a dark blue or blackish upper body and a lighter, silvery underside and are highly prized for their meat, especially in sushi and sashimi, due to their rich flavor and texture. They are migratory and are known for traveling vast distances across the oceans."

Compass Jellyfish feast on plankton and other microscopic crustaceans. The Jellyfish are rarely eaten themselves, due to their sting. "

It is fished and raised commercially and is considered the most important fish currently cultured in the Mediterranean. In Ireland, the fish sold and consumed as sea bass is exclusively the European bass."

Atlantic cod was fished for a thousand years by north European fishermen who followed it across the North Atlantic Ocean to North America. It supported the Canadian fishing economy until 1992, when the Canadian Government implemented a ban on fishing cod. Several cod stocks collapsed in the 1990s by more than 95% and many have failed to fully recover even with the cessation of fishing."

This species can be fished from the shore with simple gear, and it has been widely caught and eaten for millennia. Anchovies gather in massive groups called “schools” and are often used as fishing bait themselves. "

It is a robust crab of a reddish-brown colour, having an oval carapace with a characteristic ''pie crust'' edge and black tips to the claws. Reproduction occurs in winter, as the male stands over the female and forms a cage with his legs protecting her while she moults."

The range of the Common Octopus is wide, going from the western and eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, the southern coast of Ireland and to the southern coast of South Africa. They have evolved to have large nervous systems and brains almost comparable to dogs. They are intelligent enough to navigate mazes, recognize individual people, learn how to unscrew a jar and raid lobster traps."

They hatch in streams and rivers but move out to sea as they grow where they mature, after which the adults seasonally move upstream again to spawn. Atlantic salmon meat is a particularly nutritious food and is considered one of the more refined types of fish meat in many cultures. As such, it features in numerous popular traditional cuisines and can fetch a higher price than some other fish."

They are one of three plankton-eating shark species, along with the whale shark and megamouth shark. They are usually greyish brown, with mottled skin, with the inside of the mouth being white in colour. They are slow-moving filter feeders, and their name derives from their habit of feeding at the surface, appearing to be basking in the warmer water there. They have anatomical adaptations for filter-feeding, such as a greatly enlarged mouth."

It lives in the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean, and parts of the Mediterranean Sea, but is absent from the Baltic Sea and Black Sea. Adults emerge from their burrows at night to feed on worms and fish. It has the typical body shape of a lobster, albeit narrower. "

In the story, an ordinary salmon ate nine hazelnuts that fell into the Well of Wisdom gaining all the world's knowledge. Fionn mac Cumhaill cooked the salmon, turning it over and over, but when he touched the fish with his thumb to see if it was cooked, he burnt his finger on a drop of hot cooking fish fat. Fionn sucked on his burned finger to ease the pain, but little did Fionn know that all the salmon's wisdom had been concentrated into that one drop of fat. The deep knowledge and wisdom gained from the Salmon of Knowledge allowed Fionn to become the leader of the Fianna, the famed heroes of Irish myth."
